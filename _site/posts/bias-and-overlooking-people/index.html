      <h2 id="a-lot-of-thinking-was-done-today" tabindex="-1">A Lot of Thinking Was Done Today</h2>
<p>I was thinking today about hiring practices that use software to weed out applicants based on a word or term, an event that holds its kick-off at a bar or pub, someone choosing someone else because of an acronym after their name, or some event or decision that excludes someone based on bias.</p>
<p>At some point, some great person, some great applicant, some possible positive addition to a team, or some eloquent speaker is overlooked because of a bias. It is exclusionary, no matter how I looked at it.</p>
<p>The people that aren't given a chance are the ones that could possibly bring value somewhere. Am I at an event and not talking to someone because they choose not to be at a social mixer at a bar or pub? Is your organization missing out on top-tier talent because of software? Is your event missing out on a speaker that could be giving an excellent talk?</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-insist-on-staying-the-course%3F" tabindex="-1">Why Do We Insist On Staying the Course?</h2>
<p>The exclusion was what was on my mind and the bias that keeps people from obtaining a position or a chance to do something they may want to do. Or it may be keeping someone from networking with others in their field because they cannot be in a setting they are uncomfortable in.</p>
<p>My opportunities this year have been many and that comes from a place of privilege. That I cannot deny and need to acknowledge. I have seen people that were passed up for many opportunities that deserve the chance, mainly in the employment area. I have seen people that were passed up for talks.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people doing two, three, or four talks at a conference. I see too many events at the bar or pub or nightclub when a small group would feel safer and more included at a bowling alley or some other place free of the alcohol factor. I see people passed up for a job and ghosted, or not even given a chance to speak to a human because of software.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-paper-have-to-do-with-it%3F" tabindex="-1">What Does Paper Have to Do with It?</h2>
<p>People passed up because certifications look better to clients or employers. A piece of paper does not make a person. I say this a lot. It is time to exorcise the perception that the more pieces of paper a person has, the more qualified a person is. Acronyms do not make a person look good, but is it a gauge of the person. You could have many acronyms next to your name, but you might be difficult to work with or work for.</p>
<h2 id="let's-change-the-course" tabindex="-1">Let's Change the Course</h2>
<p>It's time to tilt the bias of tech. Without going into an in-depth definition and explanation, tech is political. Business is political. Many good people and great minds are excluded because of bias. Intentional or not, that bias needs to be erased.</p>
