      <h2 id="hey-2022" tabindex="-1">Hey 2022</h2>
<p>It wasn't fun. The pandemic is still here, it is gearing up to be worse, and still I got through you.</p>
<h2 id="lowlights" tabindex="-1">Lowlights</h2>
<ol>
<li>I got COVID in April. I was vaxxed 3 times, but the three days that it hit me hard were the worst out of the two weeks I felt like garbage.</li>
<li>I went to a fiasco in London that <em>almost</em> resulted in me talking to a room full of no one but myself.</li>
<li>People died from COVID. It still is something I find horribly wrong with this world that we could have prevented this or it could have been a lot less than it was, but we had a shit President who did nothing.</li>
<li>The pandemic still is a thing. I know a lot of people that got sick, know people who passed away.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="highlights" tabindex="-1">Highlights</h2>
<ol>
<li>I spoke at eight conferences (it felt like more), attended Smashing Conference in San Francisco and some virtuals.</li>
<li>I did not get COVID again.</li>
<li>I met a ton of great people at conferences. Too many to mention but they know who they are.</li>
<li>I went to London for the first time in over thirty years.</li>
<li>I bought a house</li>
<li>We got a cat.</li>
<li>I spent another year sober.</li>
<li>I had an amazing support system when I'm on the road that I am grateful to have.</li>
<li>I will continue to wear a mask not only to prevent me from getting sick, but to ensure I don't get anyone sick if I happen to be sick.</li>
<li>I got a great co-host for the podcast.</li>
<li>I ended season two of the podcast and we're heading into season three.</li>
<li>I spent time in six states, two continents and two countries during my travel in which I got to see a lot, eat great food, and spend time with phenomenal friends.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="looking-ahead" tabindex="-1">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>I don't like to look too far ahead but the one thing I do look forward to is this:</p>
<p>Speaking at conferences, meeting new friends and reconnecting with old friends. Moving out of accessibility by the end of the year and transitioning into a DevRel role somewhere. Traveling to more places and being sober so that I can enjoy it.</p>
<p>I hope everyone stays safe and you have a better 2023. Hope that things keep moving forward instead of backwards, that we can progress and not regress. Hope that my friends and the people I have met over the course of the time I have been in tech can enjoy some peace and some well-being during these times. Hope that humans can wake up and realize what we're doing isn't working, that maybe we need to change drastically before there is no Earth left.</p>
<p>See you in 2023.</p>
