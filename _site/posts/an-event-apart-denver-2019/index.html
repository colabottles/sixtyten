<h3 id="the-day-before">The Day Before</h3>
<p>I got into Denver after seven hors of travel, and it had been thirty-two years since I had been here. It was snowing, which I could have waited on but still I was traveling again. I got to do something I never thought I would ever do and that was attend the speaker meeting prior to the conference.</p>
<p>I got a huge bear hug from my new friend Jason Ogle, the man behind the User Defenders Podcast. One of my favorites, I highly suggest folks subscribe, listen, join the User Defenders community and become a patron on Patreon.</p>
<p>I got to meet Miriam Suzanne, Jason Ogle, Sarah Drasner, and Phil Hawksworth. I got to see Luke Wroblewski and Trent Walton again. The whole experience was due to Jason Pamental adding me as a +1 and I could not be more grateful to know Jason. An experience I will never forget and I had a phenomenal time.</p>
<h3 id="day-one">Day One</h3>
<p>Jeffrey Zeldman kicks it off with his talk on Slow Design. I could listen to this talk over and over and over. Slowing the design down makes it more comprehensive for the reader. Slowing the design down so that readers can comprehend web pages and make better decisions. Learn to make layouts that help the user relax, sit back and enjoy the design, comprehension and engagement on a much less stressful level when web pages are either too slow or too fast.</p>
<p>Jason Pamental navigated the land of Variable Fonts and Typography and as always, a super treat, Tristan and Tillie, his collies, are in his slides. Love the dog pictures and tweets! His talk included how developments in the field of typography and variable fonts make it easier to create robust, scalable typographic systems on the web. Fantastic stuff, phenomenal talk by someone I am grateful to call a friend.</p>
<p>Trent Walton talked about the repercussions of using third parties when it comes to integrating such things as a commenting system or online fonts. How much can a website weigh without you knowing it and who is tracking us? Trent also took us through tools he uses and methods to see what a site is doing behind the scenes and reasons why to use apps like Ghostery.</p>
<p>Eric Meyer came up after lunch and talked about generated content. Pullquotes, blockquotes, gradients, <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code>. Lots of great stuff, some M<em>A</em>S*H *theme music, and lots of CSS! Even an Under Construction redux using CSS. Those need to come back into style. Literally. Eric also spoke about what is good generated content, what can we do with it? How far can we push it? So much to think about when dealing with generated content.</p>
<p>Rachel Andrew followed with her "Making Things Better: Redefining the Technical Possibilities of CSS" talk. Flexbox, CSS Grid, Subgrid, some great looks at some of the current and future technical possibilities for developers and designers for creating things on the web. Multicol, Scroll snap, Subgrid. All things I am excited to implement. Page Layout was even mentioned and I didn't even remember that from her Boston talk.</p>
<p>Jen Simmons wrapped up the day of speakers with her phenomenal talk about Designing Intrinsic Layouts. Creating accessible, reusable and component layouts. The art of graphic design and how we can now do things on the web we only could dream about years prior. How to do a header real easy and simple in Grid and Flex. Jen always brings the good stuff with so many creative examples of her experiments on her own site as well.</p>
<h4 id="the-user-defenders-podcast">The User Defenders Podcast</h4>
<p>Jason Ogle came to the stage with three speakers to do a live show of his User Defenders podcast. Joined by Mina Markham, Farai Madzima, and Derek Featherstone, they traversed many subjects in the hour such as inclusion, accessibility, and ethics. It was a pleasure and privilege to be there and to have helped out in a small way by recording video of the podcast. Terrific episode!</p>
<p>The dinner after with Jason Ogle, Jason Pamental, Derek Featherstone and Eric Meyer was at a place that was referred to me by a friend, the name of the place, iRamen+Fish. It was terrific. A lot of good food and great conversation. I had a great time.</p>
<h3 id="day-two">Day Two</h3>
<p>Josh Clark, the Eleventh Strongest Man in Maine, started the day off talking about machines. Automation. "How can we use technology in a way that adds meaning?" What is it to have machine learning as a design material. What can machine learning do for us? How can we act on patterns we detect in machine learning and bringing them into the products we design and use. Slack, predictive keyboards, forms, survey tools. We can get cozy with casual uses of machine learning. I'm also gunning for that tenth spot on the list Josh!</p>
<p>Beth Dean came up next speaking about Unsolved Problems. talking about the impact of technology and the social impact it has. Design and the effects it has on people, places and things. Taking us through a walk through different places in the world and the designs done that help the social impact that benefits people and economies. Architectural designs that impact certain aspects of environments and places, what happens when designs are good and what happens when designs go bad.</p>
<p>Farai Madzima came up next. Speaking about design teams work well together to make products that make the company profitable and make the world a better place. How can we make our teams more diverse? How can we keep those people that are lost when the environments they are in aren't safe and they leave? How can we make this industry more diverse and inclusive? All are fantastic questions and the answers are there in the future, but we're working on them now. Faraiâ€™s talk captured me, entranced me, and make me think. I need to stop and assist in the need for tech to make change. A phenomenal talk that I am super glad to have seen.</p>
<p>After the lunch break, Luke Wroblewski came to the stage and showed us how people use devices today and how design needs to adapt. people spend three hours a day on mobile app and there are four billion mobile devices out there. How conversion rates increased with certain companies when removing things that were bothersome or not needed when it came to mobile devices. Remove all friction that distracts the user from experiencing the product value, don't be afraid to educate contextually when it comes to successful onboarding. Get people to product value as soon as possible, but not faster. Edit distractions and teach in the moment.</p>
<p>Mina Markham then took the stage for Full-Featured Art Direction for the Web, creator of the Pantsuit UI Pattern Library for the Hilary Clinton campaign in 2016, Mina took us through progressive enhancement and little design changes that make for huge payoffs in the end design-wise. Localization is important. Mina talked about localization on Slack and how it was rough at the beginning when the team was translating but not localizing. Inclusion and how art direction is inclusive. Very important to many, including myself and for crying out loud Beyonce! HIRE MINA MARKHAM! Mina also reminds us that not only is color contrast important for art and design, but for accessibility sake.</p>
<p>To finish off Day Two was Dan Mall talking about Putting the 'Design' in Design Systems. A deep dive into design systems, again playing the "Name That Design System" game show (which I won at Boston and did not participate in). I could listen to this talk again and again. Dan explains it's not the components, it's about how they relate to each other. How to make your design system distinct, there are multiple design principles you can use, universal principles ("accessible" and "simple"). Dan takes us through some of the most well-known design systems and how many components they have in our search for a comprehensive design system. They why's on why there are certain components with certain design systems. A great way to cap off another phenomenal day at An Event Apart.a11y</p>
<h3 id="day-three---the-final-chapter">Day Three - The Final Chapter</h3>
<p>I never look forward to the final day because itâ€™s the final day. With all good things however, they must come to an end. Kate O'Neill kicked off Day Three with human experiences in technology. Kate went into business objectives and what humans are trying to accomplish through those experiences. Building our best tech, grow our best businesses, and become our best selves. Kate touched on meaning and innovation as she spoke about things like Augmented Reality (AR), machine work, and technological capabilities. I was in Boston when Kate gave this talk and it was a good reminder to hear it again. Especially when she touched upon the Amazon Go store. People can't help other people get things off the shelf at an Amazon Go store, which takes the humanity out of the shopping experience creating a poor experience.</p>
<p>Sarah Drasner took the stage after with "Animation on the Bleeding Edge". Sarah spoke about emotions and how "the web is first and foremost about communicating". She then showed everyone Nuxt and it is impeccable timing for me to be here as I am going to be (and I already am when I can) learning Vue.js. Showing animations in Vue 2 using GreenSock. This looks like something I could really enjoy learning for sure. Different types of animations and their responsive qualities, but then Sarah took us through responsiveness in 3D! This part of her talk was terrific. Some terrific, mind-blowing demos from Sarah making me want to learn Vue and Nuxt now. This was the first time I have seen and heard Sarah speak and it was truly as phenomenal as her slides of her artwork were.</p>
<p>Val Head came up with "Making Motion Inclusive" and started off with motion. Referring to the WCAG, Val took us through the guidelines. Flashing items, movement and animation within content that may be harmful (seizure inducing triggers) on the WCAG 2.0 AA &amp; AAA levels. Val went into animation that affects folks with vestibular orders such as motion sickness and migraines. How those animations and things like parallax can physically make someone with a vestibular order (like myself) sick. Val then went into talking about <code>refers-reduced-motion</code>. Another talk I saw in Boston (that you can also read about in the archives) and another talk I was glad to hear again for sure.</p>
<p>So for lunch I decided to go out for lunch and meet up with my friend Chris DeMars. Chris, Jason Pamental, and I went to a local Mexican restaurant, La Loma, was phenomenal. Not much time to spent, but time well spent indeed and good food, good conversation.</p>
<p>Back at the conference, Derek Featherstone kicked off the last half of the final day with "Inclusive, by Design". We need to think in more diverse ways with regards to accessibility and to think of these things by default. Derek walked us through case studies and inclusion on the web and with web apps. If we include people with disabilities in the process, things will be much better. "Acknowledge your privilege, and your power, and your position in the design process." says Derek. "Ask 'How can we make sure that we include more people with disabilities earlier and more meaningfully in the process?" Derek had a lot of questions that we need to ask ourselves to be more inclusive in designs and the design process, and to include people with disabilities in that process. This is another talk I have heard, again in Boston. Well worth hearing and seeing it again.</p>
<p>and as with the last few AEA events I have attended, Gerry McGovern ended the conference with his stellar (and very humorous) talk, "Delivering Product 67". I just finished Gerry's book "Top Tasks" and it was brilliant. I have applied things in that book to the company I work for to better our product. Humility, Agility, and Simplicity. Gerry shows us how to enhance those qualities to support our company's business and advance our careers. Master the metrics of customer simplicity. I had the pleasure and privilege to have a couple of great conversations over breakfast with Gerry and he is a delight to speak with. All the speakers are! (More on that later). How to keep the garbage off of our pages, stopping the customer from doing what they really need to do. There is too much garbage on the web. Gerry points this out with the many iterations of the Google homepage.</p>
<p>and with that, the conference was over.</p>
<h3 id="the-after-conference">The After-Conference</h3>
<p>I consider myself fortunate, lucky, and pretty damn grateful. With that said, I got to hang out with Jason Pamental and Miriam Suzanne and a new conference friend for some time, eating Indian cuisine at a local place Miriam took us too nearby, then hanging out at the restaurant at the hotel and talking for hours. During the way, I had met TJ Pitre and we got to talking as well. This is why I enjoy the conferences I go to. I meet a mix of people far and wide. I don't want to meet the same people over and over and over who are like me. Which is why I strongly advocate for diversity and inclusion. Which is why Farai's talk hit me at the very core.</p>
<p>After some lengthy conversation I retired to my room and then prepared to rest for the long trek back home. I really don't like the end process after the conferences because I meet so many great people and talk to some very smart folks in the course of three days (even more because I get there a day early and stay a day late).</p>
