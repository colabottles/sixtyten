      <h2 id="it's-a-great-song!" tabindex="-1">It's a great song!</h2>
<p>Joe Jackson has a timeless catchy tune with that one. That's not what this is about though. This is about me and stepping out of the accessibility space and time for a change.</p>
<p>It's been a bit. I've been thinking about this and where I want to go moving forward in the next few months, that's not in the direction that I am currently in. It's a total &quot;back to square one&quot; type thing. Back to where I was over forty years ago when I first sat in front of a Commodore PET 2001 Series computer and wondered how this screen was taking information from a cassette tape and making a game appear on the screen.</p>
<p>The last couple of days has solidified that I am making the right call. I want that nine year old kid I used to be back. The passion, the fire, the curiosity. I <strong>need</strong> that. I <strong>want</strong> that.</p>
<h2 id="burn-out" tabindex="-1">Burn Out</h2>
<p>It is also about burn out. I am trying to get out of that hole currently and it seems every time I make progress, something or someone comes out of the weeds and throws a wrench into the works. It's time for change. Which means it is time for me to leave accessibility. Not advocacy, but the work. I can't do it anymore. It's Sisyphean at this point for me. no matter how much time I take off.</p>
<p>I'm no longer interested in auditing or remediation. I have done too much of it the past decade, too much of it, and I am out of gas. I am beyond exhausted.</p>
<h2 id="now-what%3F" tabindex="-1">Now What?</h2>
<p>I have some irons in the fire. Make it known I am set on getting a job in Developer Relations or Developer Experience. I have my goal set on one company that I have been engrossed in their documentation for a few months now. I have my resume out and some interviews have been had, but my goal.</p>
<p>That goal is where I want to be in a few months. Because I know that I can excel at it, I know I'd be good at it, and I know the 12 year old Todd who would pull all-nighters and study code and read computer books, manuals, magazines, take apart computers and put them back together again, I know that kid would be back and the curiosity will return which drove the fire under me.</p>
<p>It isn't up to me to decide, that's not in my control. My control lies in how I get there and present myself.</p>
<p>I want to be able to read minds, but at this point, I need to not overthink it. The way I am made up though, I overthink as good as the best of the rest.</p>
<h2 id="fin" tabindex="-1">Fin</h2>
<p>I hope to have a better picture in July as to where I am and what I am doing because right now, I'm a bit lost. I can admit it. I don't feel like I have a home. I have a speaker family and I have a great group of friends that support me, but I am a bit cut off from where I want to be.</p>
<p>I hope to get there and report back soon. Send some positive vibes this way, I could sure use them.</p>
