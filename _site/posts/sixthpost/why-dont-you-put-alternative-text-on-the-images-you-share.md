## Is This Thing On&quest;&excl;

As of this writing it is Sunday. I went on Twitter and as usual, I saw many images without alternative text (a.k.a. "alt text"). Why? Does the thought of describing a picture that **you** put up on Twitter or anywhere else on social media bother you? Is it too much to ask for? Are you allergic to helping out the people that need the picture conveyed to them by their screen reader?

This is a high-level rant. I'm not going to get into the different kinds of screen readers or assistive technologies that help people by reading the alternative text back to them. I'm not going to get into the different kinds of alternative text and for what each of them go with when you put up an image, for instance decorative images with empty or null alt text. I'm not going down that road.

## Questions. Oh So Many Questions&excl;

So many questions as to "why" that I have to ask. Are you forgetting to do it? Do you just don't know how to do it? Do you not give a shit and don't care to do it? So many questions. So little time to go through the entire lot of you and explain the why's. So I'll do it here, in a hopefully easy, clear, and in plain language everyone can understand (he said as he typed with somne snark behind it to go along with the venom that is packed in there a bit).

Alternative text, for those who do not know, is text that is added to the picture you're going to share so that screen reader users and users of other assistive technologies can understand when the content of the image is read back to them. Yes, there is computer software and hardware that actually does this! Why? Because people with disabilities are people too.

They use the internet just like you. They use Twitter just like you. They want to know the information JUST LIKE YOU but they have that information read back to them differently because either they can't see or they have a hard time seeing words and letters. Or maybe, they have a hard time reading, so they use software to help them! Or maybe they can't read, so the same applies. They have software that helps them!

So what is holding you back from doing it? Helping others out so they can understand what the picture is instead of hearing, _"DSC0004dhfguiregvfrt345ytt6h5hy4.jpg"_
