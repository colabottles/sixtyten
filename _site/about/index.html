                <p>
                  Hi, I'm Todd. I am a Senior Front End Developer and
                  Accessibility Advocate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have over twenty one years of experience with the web. It
                  all started with seeing a Commodore PET running Oregon Trail
                  in fifth grade. That fascination with moving pixels on a
                  computer screen led to a Commodore64 and the user manual that
                  came with it and programming in BASIC. I am currently
                  self-taught in all areas of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript,
                  and proficient with React. I am learning Vue and NextJS,
                  experimenting with all sorts of cool CSS features.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have a passion for the web and making things on the web.
                  Taking things apart and re-building them. I am interested in a
                  lot of different things, mainly outdoors, food, and travel.
                  Photography, typography, design and User Experience. Web
                  conferences and meeting people in the web industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My skills include HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, SQL,
                  ColdFusion (CFML), and Ruby/Rails to name a few. I have
                  experience using many content management systems, namely
                  WordPress (since it was forked from b2/Cafelog), Drupal, and a
                  host of others. Open source experience and design. Branding
                  experience with the Adobe Creative Cloud and such programs as
                  QuarkXPress, Maya, Cinema4D, Final Cut Pro, and Flash (I know,
                  dead in the water).
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have never settled for being an expert in just one thing and
                  have always dabbled in many. Which is why I have a host of
                  experience with hardware and software over the years. My
                  thirst to learn in great and it started as a kid and continues
                  right up to this very day. I've been a chef, a laborer, I
                  worked at Wizards of the Coast once, I worked third-shift at a
                  grocery store, I've been a floorer, roofer, laborer, retail
                  salesman, server, dishwasher, and once had an interesting
                  conversation with Michael Bolton, the
                  singer/songwriter/artist.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have worked with many different people and places on
                  projects, and the list of clients whom I have done work for in
                  some capacity is long but I can send a list if anyone is
                  interested. They are not current or even recent projects
                  though and the work is not on the web anymore (though it may
                  be on the Wayback Machine).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thanks for reading and

                  so we can talk about whatever questions you may have or maybe
                  about me filling a role at your company. I am also willing
                  (very willing if it a warm climate) to relocate.
