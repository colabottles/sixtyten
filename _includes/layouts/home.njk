      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>I'm Todd. I am an Accessibility Specialist for Knowbility, I am also a member of the W3C. This is my personal site where I write and document what I am doing where I am speaking, what conference I'll be attending. Tech has been a huge part of my life for over forty years from when I started with BASIC and Scheme, and now with React, JavaScript, and Accessibility.</p>

      <p>My focus is on Accessibility. It is very important to me and I do advocate for accessibility. Accessibility is something everyone in tech/web needs to practice and implement. I try and educate and advocate for that as well as making the web inclusive and accessible for all.</p>
      <p>I host a podcast, the Front End Nerdery Podcast. I write articles for publication and like to write and I love food and cooking. Especially lobster and lobster rolls.</p>
