      <h1>Hello there!</h1>

      <p>I'm Todd. I am an Accessibility Engineer for <a href="https://webstaurantstore.com">WebstaurantStore</a>, I am also a member of the <a href="https://w3.org">W3C</a>. This is my personal site where I write and document what I am doing, where I am speaking, or what conferences I'll be attending. Tech has been a huge part of my life for over forty years from when I started with BASIC and Scheme, and now with React, JavaScript, and Accessibility.</p>

      <h2>Other things I do.</h2>
      <p>My focus is on Accessibility. It is very important to me and I do advocate for accessibility. Accessibility is something everyone in tech/web needs to practice and implement. I try and educate and advocate for that as well as making the web inclusive and accessible for all.</p>
      <p>I host a podcast, the <a href="https://youtube.com/FrontEndNerdery">Front End Nerdery Podcast</a>. I write articles for publication and I have written articles for Smashing Magazine and CSS-Tricks, and I love food and cooking. Especially lobster and lobster rolls.</p>
