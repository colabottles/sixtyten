### It Has Been A Hot Minute

After a lot of travel speaking at conferences and getting myself out there and advocating for the accessibility community, I finally got to clearning my schedule in between moving to a new home and all the work I have been doing in the W3C and at work to write something.

I'll be writing more. This is just something to add to the site until I can sit down and complete the three or four articles drafts I have sitting in my repo that are prime for the publishing.

I have decided though to shift left and try my hand at Developer Adovcate. My DevRel friends have told me I am halfway to becoming a full DevRel, so I figured, &quot;why not?!&quot; I cna do it, I have been doing it to some extent. I just haven't been dealing with developers and being a brand ambassador. Something I can do if I can get a company to give me a chance to do so. I think I could do it and it is the next step in my career I believe.

Other than that, I am going to continue my W3C work, but at the beginning of 2023, it will be at a much lesser capacity. I am glad I got to work on WCAG 2.2 as little as I did and sit in and learn from all the great folks I have been a member of groups and subgroups with and I look forward to the work on WCAG 3, but I have to get my spoons back.

I think DevRel will be an exciting change and a chance to get back into coding and something I have been missing for the past two years now. Front and backend development work. Now just to enjoy my upcoming two week vacation next week, then get back to pecking at the keyboard and up-to-speed on a bunch of exciting stuff.

Until next time, that is all.
