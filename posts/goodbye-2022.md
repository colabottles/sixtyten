## Hey 2022

It wasn't fun. The pandemic is still here, it is gearing up to be worse, and still I got through you.

## Lowlights

- I got COVID in April. I was vaxxed 3 times, but the three days that it hit me hard were the worst out of the two weeks I felt like garbage.
- I went to a fiasco in London that _almost_ resulted in me talking to a room full of no one but myself.
- People died from COVID. It still is something I find horribly wrong with this world that we could have prevented this or it could have been a lot less than it was, but we had a shit President who did nothing.
- The pandemic still is a thing. I know a lot of people that got sick, know people who passed away.

## Highlights

- I spoke at eight conferences, attended Smashing Conference in San Francisco.
- I did not get COVID again.
- I met a ton of great people at conferences. Too many to mention but they know who they are.
- I went to London for the first time in over thirty years.
- I bought a house
- We got a cat.
- I spent another year sober.
- I had an amazing support system when I'm on the road that I am grateful to have.
- I will continue to wear a mask not only to prevent me from getting sick, but to ensure I don't get anyone sick if I happen to be sick.
- I got a great co-host for the podcast.
- I ended season two of the podcast and we're heading into season three.
- I spent time in six states, two continents and two countries during my travel in which I got to see a lot, eat great food, and spend time with phenomenal friends.

## Looking Ahead

I don't like to look too far ahead but the one thing I do look forward to is this:
