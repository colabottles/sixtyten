## Don't Believe Everything You Read

Misinformation is quite the thing these days. It has been for at least a decade which is as far as I can think back to the first time I saw misinformation or disinformation. It probably (and undoubtedly) has existed since the &quot;modern&quot; internet came about (let's call it Web 2.0 for the lack of a better term).

I'll share what I posted on LinkedIn a few weeks back.

> Stumbled upon more misinformation about WCAG 3 and I can tell you with 100% certainty, the same goes with APCA, that they are both exploratory and public beta respectively. Not at all close to being standard.
>
> With regard to WCAG 3: “Status: Exploratory Draft. The May 2024 WCAG 3 Working Draft includes potential outcomes that we are exploring. The final set of outcomes in WCAG 3 will be different from this draft. Outcomes will be edited, added, combined, and removed.”
>
> The key words there being “exploratory draft”. Until such time it is a “W3C Recommendation” and until such time you go to read it and it states in the “Status of this document” section, “W3C recommends the wide deployment of this specification as a standard for the Web.” Then it will have been approved for publication and use.
>
> With regard to APCA: “APCA W3 is in public beta” and on the GitHub repo page, under the disclaimer, it is even stated:
>
> “APCA is being evaluated as a replacement for WCAG 2 contrast math for future standards and guidelines, however, standards that will be incorporating APCA are still developmental.”
>
> The key word there is “developmental “. Meaning “in development”, not ready for broader public use.
>
> The current recommendations are the WCAG 2.2 guidelines and the current WCAG color-contrast scoring method.
>
> There is work being done by lots of great people in the W3C to develop WCAG 3 and APCA but they aren&apos;t at all close to published work, unanimous approval, or recommendation status.
>
> So, anyone telling you or posting and proclaiming that WCAG 3 and APCA are the standard, are ready for use, are accepted at any official level, are being used by governments at any level (local through federal) are not well-informed, not knowing or reading any of the documentation, or just flat out serving up misinformation and aren&apos;t aware of the confusion they are causing.
>
> TL;DR: WCAG 3 and APCA are not approved standards and won&apos;t be for many, many years.

Note: WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and APCA (Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm)

After that, I figured I may not see anything else for a little while, but I always prove myself wrong. Today in my online travels I once again found more misinformation. I urge you or anyone to call this out and educate people that are unknowingly spreading this around (or maybe knowingly, you never know) and correct it before it becomes a huge problem like most of the issues we see today with the spreading of mis and disinformation.
