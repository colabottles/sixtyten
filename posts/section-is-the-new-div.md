## Remember when&hellip;

We used to have tables for layouts? Then we had the trusty `div` element and it took off like a rocket! you see div soup as far as the eyes can see.

So since this craze started taking hold, many developers are grabbing the reins and sowing the seeds in the fields of web pages with divs. Planting and nurturing them until their web site blooms fully. A garden of divs for everyone to see.

Then the accessibility people said, "Wait a minute. Try not to use so many divs. They hold no semantic meaning and use semantic HTML elements like `section` it is much better for accessibility." Then the gardeners that are the developers started using the section element, and planting those seeds. And planting them. And planting them.

Now we have a garden, not only overflowing with `div` elements, but that same garden we call the Web is not choking with the overplanting of `section` elements.
