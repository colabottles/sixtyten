## Shocked

The words fail me. [An Event Apart is no more](https://www.aneventapart.com/).

From the first time I heard about the conference, to the first conference I attended and had an anxiety attack of epic proportions that Jeffrey Zeldman witnessed, to the scores of wonderful people I met, the fantastic speakers I went to see and learn from, to the people I connected with. I will truly miss it.

## Pandemic Times

Without going into pandemic or endemic gobbeldygook, the pandemic has done this to conferences as is with other spaces pre-COVID times. With a heavy heart, I respect the decision and I am sad I did not get to go to the San Francisco event this month. I'll miss seeing faces and people I was seeing yearly when going like Eric and Jeffrey, Marci and all the other crew setting up and working hard to put on one the best shows a conference can possibly put on.

Thank you, Jeffrey and Eric for creating this and making it what it was. It will be strange to not go to another AEA again, but with changing times, comes changing gears. I got the opportunity to meet a ton of wonderful people and I will always remember that, the talks, the fun.

Thank you Team AEA.
