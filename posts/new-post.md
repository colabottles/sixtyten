## Placeholders. The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing

I've been seeing a lot of placeholders in forms and in search bars for a very long time now. I am certain accessibility experts and engineers have seent he very same thing. So why? Why do we keep seeing these knowing (some of us) that they are not the same as a label?

Or even worse, where is the education on accessibility?
