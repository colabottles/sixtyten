## Regrets, I Have A Few

There are some decisions in life I would like to change, some I would not change for anything. Leaving Bluesky might be one of those I wish I could take back.

So I re-joined the crowd over at Bluesky again. After the beta testing and all the other testing they were doing before they opened it up and even after they opened it up more and more it was just lifeless it seemed. Forgotten or just ignored.

It has been infinitely better this time around, find familiar faces, meeting new ones, enjoying how social media was 10-20 years ago, if not longer. No bullshit.

I shall see how it shapes up in the near future, but right now I'm riding the wave of a decent and happy social scene.
