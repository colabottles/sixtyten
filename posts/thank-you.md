I would like to take the time to address everyone who reached out to me and who left messages on the socials I inhabit:

Thank you all.

I thank you all for your support and your kindness. The decision wasnâ€™t an easy one and to be honest, I have fought the urge for many, many years.

The positive messages and the kind words, a lot of you have had have moved me. I did not know a guy like me, who put himself out there very late in life got so lucky to have such a great network of people he met, knows, admires, and respects highly.

Keeping this as short as possible, I have seen the messages and I just want to say to those of you who have reached out, thank you. It means the world to me as well as each and every one of you.

For context you can [interact with this link to read up](https://toddl.dev/posts/the-decision-to-leave-tech/) on what this means.
