I have gotten word that the doctor is now the source of the hold up with finding out test results or even testing and what is going on with my significant other. This in itself is a weight on the mind and I can't imagine the weight she is dealing with herself.

Medically, I am coming out of the other side of the woods and things are, for now, calm. So there is some progress there.

The care for someone elderly and lsing cognitive faculties is exhausting and I do not wish this on anyone. Growing old is hard enough, dealing with things like dementia or Parkinson's is worse. I have a lot of empathy for those who are going through it as well.

It has been ten days since the last update and I want to thank those of you who reached out with kind words and thoughts, it means an awful lot to me and I am greatful to have those and your time writing to me.

Hopefully, I have a couple of developer relation roles I hope to get the interview process underway and see where those lead. On the development front, I have not been so lucky.

Things have leveled out somewhat, so I have some time to be able to jump back into the W3C meetings and continue working to get the deceptive patterns work published in the WCAG 3 documents.

Until then, enjoy the holidays that are rapidly approaching with your families and enjoy the rest of 2024 while it lasts!
